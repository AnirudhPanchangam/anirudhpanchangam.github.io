This year has been the best one yet for me in terms of personal development.  
I have successfully gotten into programming like I have never before and  
as evidenced by this blog, I'm getting into the habit of documenting my learnings.  
How great is that? I hope to post some really exiting stuff(mostly about programming and computers) very soon.
I'm currently in the process of generating some really good content.

Stay tuned...
