Hi, there.
I'm a professional software engineer working in the domain of web development.
However, I also try to keep my knowledge up to date on systems programming as well as networking as well as a host of ither things.
I enjoy listening to music and watching movies like most other people. I'm pretty much average.
Hope this goes well.
